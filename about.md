<p class="message">
I am an aspiring data scientist, passionate about data and motivated to develop promising data-driven applications revolutionizing the industry. I have been working endlessly to improve my predictive modeling skills, increase my understanding of various machine learning algorithms, and practice my data wrangling abilities in problems such as creating customer segments and approving loan requests. I am ambitious, courageous, and adaptive to new challenges.

During my transition to data science, I moved away from the traditional educational approach and took it upon myself to deepen my capabilities and skillset. I developed my own curriculum tailored to my interests, moving from mechanical engineering to working more with software when I saw what data can offer. From producing artificially intelligent technology to solving current health issues in the medical industry, data science is the future solution that can be applied to the many problems we face in society on a daily basis.

I enjoy listening to other individualâ€™s ideas and their unique approach to solving a variety of problems. Understanding diverse ideas drives me to become a critical thinker when faced with upcoming challenges to create optimal solutions that can result in a positive impact on others. My growth strongly stems from the kind of knowledge that continues to pose questions and demands for solutions. It, thus, became my mission to never stop learning as it is important to be inspired as well as be an inspiration to others. Data science is a form of art, allowing others to creatively manipulate data and mold it into what they want it to be.

With that said, I am open to opportunities to personally grow in a field I know I can thrive in.
